🚗 Smart Robot Car (Arduino Based)

This project implements an Arduino-powered smart robot car with multiple control and automation features:

🔹 Features

Obstacle Avoiding 🚧 – Uses ultrasonic sensors to detect and avoid obstacles automatically.

Voice Control 🎙️ – Control the car using voice commands via an Android app / Google Assistant.

Bluetooth Control 📱 – Wireless control using a smartphone with Bluetooth HC-05 module.

Smart Parking System 🅿️ – Automatic car parking assistance using sensors for space detection.
