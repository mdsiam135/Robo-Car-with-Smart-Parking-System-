This project involves creating a multifunctional robot car with obstacle avoidance, voice control, Bluetooth control, and a parking system using Arduino. The robot car navigates autonomously, using Ultrasonic sensors to detect and avoid obstacles, with real-time adjustments managed by the Arduino microcontroller. Voice control is implemented via a recognition module, while Bluetooth control allows remote operation through smartphones. 


Objective
To design and implement a versatile robotic car system using Arduino, featuring obstacle avoidance, voice control, and Bluetooth connectivity. Additionally, develop a smart parking system for conventional vehicles, integrating Arduino technology to enhance efficiency, user convenience and safely parking.
